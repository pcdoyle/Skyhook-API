# Skyhook-API

This is the repository I will be using to build the API for Skyhook's Twitch stream at SkyhookArt.com

Will keep updating this as time goes on.

#### Requirements
* Python 3 (https://python.org) and Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org).
* The following modules:
  * Flask - Flask framework for web python.
  * datetime - Date utilities.
  * python-dateutil - Date utilities.
  * requests - For API HTTPS requests (Weather Underground and Twitch API).
  * pint - For unit conversions.
    * Note: Probably going to replace this module as I don't like it.
* A config.py file for the API keys, it's example file is in the repository as "config.py.example."

### Usage
* The master branch is active on http://api.skyhookart.com/

## NOTE:
This is a work in progress and the first major project I have worked on in Python, as well as the first project that I have used to make Twitch API calls. This project is going to change A LOT. I'll probably have to clean up code while I learn Python.

I will have to spend a lot more time documenting as well, though I have comments to explain what every function is for.

### TO-DO:
* Clean up functions, and standardize the naming scheme for them.
